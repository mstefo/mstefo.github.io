                <p class="gameInfoText">
                    Overwatch (2016) is a team based hero shooter developed by Activision Blizzard. In 2019, the game received
                    an update to introduce the Workshop. This is a simplified scripting system using a proprietary language to
                    expose the built-in systems of the game to any player. This webpage is dedicated to a portion of the Workshop 
                    projects I had created over the years.

                <p class="gameInfoText">
                    Partner Puzzles is a 2-player cooperative puzzle experience where the players must
                    work together to figure out how to reach the exit. Unfortunately, due to the evolving
                    nature of Overwatch as a live-service game, most of these projects have broken challenges.

                    Hanamura Havoc is a player versus environment (PVE) game mode where players attempt to

                    unlock new abilities (called "Skills") to enhance their capabilities in order to survive
                    as long as possible. There are over 150 Skills to unlock. In addition, every couple of rounds
                    players will need to complete a certain objective in order to receive bonus rewards or, if 
                    they fail, strengthen the enemies. Finally, some rounds will have global effects added to 
                    disrupt players further such as forcing them to run forward or enemies exploding when eliminated
